  Modbus RTU Slave example

  Example that shows how to set up a Modbus RTU Slave with Coils,
  Discrete Inputs, Holding and Input Registers.

  Slave is configured with the following:
   - Coils: 5 consecutive coils starting at address 700.
   - Discrete Inputs: 5 consecutive discrete inputs starting at address 800.
   - Holding Registers: 2 consecutive holding registers starting at address 900.
   - Input Registers: 10 consecutive input registers starting at address 1000.


  Values stored in the Modbus RTU Slave are known and can be checked
  by requesting its data with a Modbus RTU Master properlly configured.
